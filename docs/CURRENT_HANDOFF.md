# Current Handoff

Last updated: July 3, 2026 (Phase E Slice 4 approved, PR #80 → DONE-LOG. **This closes the entire
grocery/pantry milestone** — all four slices shipped. **Next Up is intentionally empty: Jon picks the next
dispatch target from the Ready queue.** Lean verification is the default.)

The **short entry point** for a fresh Yes Chef conversation. This file is deliberately lean: it holds
**Next Up** (the dispatch target), the **Ready Efforts** queue, and the **Verification Pattern** —
nothing else. Completed-slice history, the implemented-behavior checkpoint, and strategic background
live in [`docs/DONE-LOG.md`](DONE-LOG.md) (read-rarely archive — do **not** read it on a dispatch).
`docs/AGENTS.md` remains the authoritative project/agent guide.

## Next Up

**Single dispatch target.** Dispatch to the coding agent with:
*"Do the Next Up effort in `docs/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`."* If this section is empty, missing, or
ambiguous, the agent must **STOP and ask Jon — never infer the next task.** See
`docs/AGENTS.md` § Work Intake & Dispatch. A dispatch may bundle **several cohesive slices** (one
PR); do all listed, in order.

**None — awaiting Jon's pick.** The grocery/pantry milestone (Phase E) closed with Slice 4 (PR #80 →
DONE-LOG), so there is **no inferred next slice**. Per the dispatch rule above, do **not** guess: Jon selects
the next dispatch target from the **Ready Efforts** queue below. Genuinely-open named candidates:
**Menu + Meal-Planner chat verbs** and **reader photo affordances** (both in
[`docs/efforts/cooking-workspace.md`](efforts/cooking-workspace.md)), or the parked **two-device dogfood**
once iOS Beta 3 lands. (The actionable-chat / LLMClientKit lift is **already complete** — Slices 1–2 + the
Chef It Up / Serve With / substitution verbs, PRs #73–#75 → DONE-LOG; not a candidate.) Once chosen, expand
it here into a concrete slice list before dispatching.

**Standing release follow-up carried from Phase E (not a dispatch on its own):** before any prod/TestFlight
cut, promote the Slice 3 pantry-policy + `canonicalName` CloudKit fields to the **production** schema, and
note the app target (`PantryViews.swift` / `GroceryViews.swift`) compiles only in Jon's device pass, not CI.

Phase E is **fully complete** — Slice 4 (`PantrySuppression` + review UI, PR #80 → DONE-LOG), Slice 3
(pantry policy + `canonicalName` migration, PR #79 → DONE-LOG), Slices 1 + 2 (canonical key + `Measure`,
PR #77 → DONE-LOG). Dogfood batch 3 is
**complete** (ingredient structure · Chef It Up + Serve With · substitution ·
keep-awake; PR #75 → DONE-LOG). The cooking-workspace effort is **complete** (Slices A + B shipped,
PRs #73 / #74 → DONE-LOG). Its named
follow-ons — **Menu + Meal-Planner chat verbs** and **reader photo affordances** — live in
[`docs/efforts/cooking-workspace.md`](efforts/cooking-workspace.md) as separate later efforts.

## Ready Efforts (queue)

Drawn into **Next Up** as needed (one dispatch, one or more cohesive slices); not itself a dispatch
target.

- **Recipe → grocery list w/ pantry checking** (Phase E) — **complete.** All four slices shipped: canonical
  key + `Measure` (PR #77), pantry policy + `canonicalName` migration (PR #79), `PantrySuppression` + review
  UI (PR #80) — all → DONE-LOG. Design rationale = [[grocery-pantry-threshold-design]]. Standing release
  follow-up (promote CloudKit fields to prod schema) noted under Next Up.

- **Actionable chat / LLMClientKit** (ADR-0011) — **complete.** The lift (Slice 1, 3 repos) + make-ahead
  (Slice 2) + Chef It Up / Serve With / per-line substitution shipped 2026-07-02/03 (PRs #73–#75 →
  DONE-LOG); `LLMClientKit` is a live path-dep. Remaining named-later verbs (**Menu + Meal-Planner chat
  verbs**) live in [`docs/efforts/cooking-workspace.md`](efforts/cooking-workspace.md); classify each new
  verb's commit shape first ([[chat-verb-commit-shapes]]).

- **Dogfood fixes — batch 3** — complete (PR #75 → DONE-LOG; ingredient structure · Chef It Up +
  Serve With · substitution · keep-awake). Non-blocking device-pass notes recorded in the DONE-LOG entry.

- **Dogfood fixes — batches 1 & 2** — complete (PR #66, PR #71 → DONE-LOG). The batch-1 Slice 7
  delete-source-clobbers-amount-edit follow-up remains parked in
  [`docs/efforts/dogfood-fixes-batch-1.md`](efforts/dogfood-fixes-batch-1.md) for a later grocery slice.

- **Cooking workspace** — **complete** (Slices A + B, PRs #73 / #74 → DONE-LOG). Menu + Meal-Planner chat
  verbs and the reader **photo affordances** (manual set-as-cover, pinch-zoom in the viewer) are named in
  [`docs/efforts/cooking-workspace.md`](efforts/cooking-workspace.md) as later efforts (host built
  context-general to receive them).

**Parked (not dispatched):**
- **Dogfood the core loop on two devices** — capture ~15–20 real recipes via the extension, cook from
  them (phone captures / iPad cooks, exercising the untested multi-device dedup-on-read convergence).
  Blocked on Apple shipping iOS Beta 3; Jon's simulator-pass feedback still marinating. The most
  annoying gaps found here still choose the real next milestone after the dogfood batch.

Comment ingestion stays in `docs/open-questions.md` until it is a scoped effort. Full completed-work
history and the implemented-behavior checkpoint are in [`docs/DONE-LOG.md`](DONE-LOG.md).

## Verification Pattern

Lean by default — the cost center is the build/simulator loop, not the code, and Jon does the
device pass regardless. So verify with **compiler + tests once**, then hand off:

- Run `xcodegen generate` after adding Swift source files.
- For package/logic-only changes, `swift build` the package (cheaper than a full app build).
- Otherwise build `YesChef` **once** for `iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) (16GB)` (`-skipMacroValidation`).
- Run `scripts/check-drift.sh`.
- **Do not install/launch on simulators by default** — skip the install loop and hand straight to
  Jon's UI pass. Only boot/install a simulator when a change genuinely can't be confirmed from build
  + tests, and say why in the PR.

Jon performs the primary UI testing pass on `iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) (16GB)` and `iPhone 17 Pro`.
