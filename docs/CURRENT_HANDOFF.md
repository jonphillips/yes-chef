# Current Handoff

Last updated: July 1, 2026 (**PR #46 architect-approved → M4 Slice 2 (CloudKit `SyncEngine`
wiring, started OFF) is DONE** — on-device dev round-trip still owed before the S4 flip, not a
blocker for S3). Next Up = M4 Slice 3, logical-uniqueness hardening (upsert + dedup-on-read) —
[`milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md`](milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md) § Slice 3).

Use this as the short entry point when starting a fresh Yes Chef conversation.
`docs/AGENTS.md` remains the authoritative project/agent guide.

## Next Up

**Single dispatch target.** Dispatch to the coding agent with:
*"Do the Next Up effort in `docs/CURRENT_HANDOFF.md`."* If this section is empty,
missing, or ambiguous, the agent must **STOP and ask Jon — never infer the next
task.** See `docs/AGENTS.md` § Work Intake & Dispatch.

- **M4 (iCloud sync) — Slice 3: logical-uniqueness hardening (upsert + dedup-on-read)** —
  [`milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md`](milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md) § Slice 3. With no unique indexes,
  offline two-device inserts can create duplicate rows for the same logical key; make reads
  deterministic and self-healing. **Import identity** (`recipeImportRef`, composed normalized
  `sourceURL` + `title`): make the import path an **upsert** and add **dedup-on-read** — when >1 row
  shares a key, pick one deterministically (lowest `id` / earliest `dateCreated`) and a cleanup pass
  deletes the losers, re-pointing any `recipeID` references; reuse M1's composed-identity logic.
  **Audit other logically-unique data** for the same hazard (default `GroceryList` `isDefault`,
  `Tag`/`Category` by name, `PantryItem` by title) and record a per-entity dedup decision (a
  duplicate default list is a real bug; two same-named tags may be tolerable). **Tests:** seed
  duplicates (simulating two offline inserts), assert dedup converges to one row deterministically
  and references survive. No device testing needed — pure convergence logic. Dispatchable now.

M4 Slice 2 — CloudKit `SyncEngine` wiring (started OFF) — **DONE** (PR #46, architect-approved):

- Additive CloudKit **dev** entitlements (iCloud container `iCloud.com.jon.yeschef`, CloudKit
  service, `aps-environment`, `UIBackgroundModes = remote-notification`) via XcodeGen.
  `attachMetadatabase()` + `SyncEngine(startImmediately: false)` in `bootstrapDatabase` enumerating
  all 23 synced `@Table`s; iCloud account-status launch gate; sync opt-in defaults **OFF**. Share
  extension **constructs a stopped engine** (`.configured(startImmediately: false)`) purely to
  install triggers / write `SyncMetadata` — it never starts or networks (**construct ≠ run**;
  `bootstrapDatabase` and `bootstrapDatabaseForShareExtension` now differ only by store path).
  `categories.parentCategoryID` loosened from a self-referential FK to a plain UUID column
  (SQLiteData rejects the self-FK as a schema cycle). Drift test derives both sides from the live DB
  (installed sync triggers vs. `sqlite_master` tables) so a new unsynced `@Table` fails the test.
- **Still owed before S4 (the Production flip), not a prerequisite for S3:** on-device CloudKit
  **dev** round-trip — capture a recipe via the **share extension**, foreground the main app with
  sync enabled, confirm it lands in the dev dashboard and round-trips on relaunch. This is the one
  link no unit test covers: that the main app actually uploads extension-written metadata.

M4 Slice 1 — lean original-provenance — **DONE** (PR #45 merged):

- `RecipeBundleCoding.snapshotData` now strips `originalImportText` and photo `displayData`/
  `thumbnailData` from the snapshot blob (metadata + `imageDataReference` retained); import/capture
  bundle creation defaults `originalImportText == nil` via a test-only `preserveRawImportHTML` seam.
  Transfer `RecipeBundle` untouched (photo bytes still transfer). Snapshot is passive provenance —
  no production consumer of `decodeSnapshot`. Compare-to-original view still deferred to a later slice.

M3 authenticated browser capture — **DONE** (PR #44 merged, `2f5b588`):

- **Capture editorial prose blocks** ("Why This Recipe Works" / "Before You Begin") —
  `docs/efforts/editorial-prose.md`. Scoped DOM scrape (`RecipeEditorialProseExtractor`) mapping the
  blocks to labeled recipe notes, schema-first parser untouched; `WebRecipeEditorialProseTests`.
- **Show & curate notes + hero image in the review UIs** —
  `docs/efforts/share-review-notes-and-image.md`. Notes shown with inline edit + per-block delete,
  plus a read-only hero preview, in **both** the share-extension review (`ShareViewController`) and
  the in-app browser capture review (`RecipeCaptureView`). Emptied notes drop at save/bundle time.

## Ready Efforts (queue)

Drawn into **Next Up** one at a time; this is not a dispatch target.

1. **Early `expectedContentLength` guard on hero download** — `WebRecipeCaptureClient.fetchImageData`
   (`WebRecipeCaptureClient.swift:227`) enforces the 12 MB `maxImageResponseBytes` cap only *after*
   `URLSession.shared.data` has fully buffered the response (`:233→:240`), so it doesn't bound peak
   download memory in the ~120 MB share extension — an oversized body is downloaded in full, then
   rejected. Add a one-line `response.expectedContentLength` pre-check to bail before buffering an
   oversized image. Small, deterministic, no device testing needed. (Supersedes the earlier
   "real-device jetsam check": the decode itself is already memory-safe via
   `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` + `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize` downsampling in
   `RecipePhotoProcessor`, which never materializes the full-resolution bitmap, so the residual gap
   is the unbounded *download* buffer, not the decode.) Standalone; not on the sync critical path.

Comment ingestion stays in `docs/open-questions.md` until it is a scoped effort.

**Fork resolved (2026-06-30):** M3 capture is done and the pivot to the **iCloud sync gate** is
made — it's now the active milestone ([`milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md`](milestones/M4-icloud-sync.md),
Phase E). The full build order is authored (S1 lean provenance → S2 CloudKit setup + `SyncEngine`
wiring, off → S3 dedup-on-read hardening → S4 clean cutover/flip → S5 two-device verification).
Modeling stays sync-safe and deferred (no canonical-ingredient work before the flip). Ratified by
[ADR-0010](decisions/ADR-0010-cloudkit-sync-enablement.md); M3 recorded in
[ADR-0009](decisions/ADR-0009-in-app-authenticated-browser-capture.md).

## Current Checkpoint

The current slice scaffolds meal planning, menus, and grocery lists with
source-preserving generated grocery items, a review step before adding generated
ingredients, and first-pass menu/calendar planning polish.

Implemented behavior:

- A durable `mealPlanItems` SQLite table and `MealPlanItem` core model.
- Meal plan items support recipes and freeform notes now, with a reserved
  `reservation` kind and optional start/end time fields for later restaurant or
  iCal-style work.
- A month-first Meal Calendar workspace in the existing app shell, with month,
  week, and day display modes.
- Add recipe/add note flows from the calendar, plus a `Plan` toolbar button on
  recipe detail that starts a preselected recipe plan item.
- A durable menu schema with `menus`, `menuItems`, and `menuPlacements`.
- Menus can contain recipe dishes and freeform notes, be placed on the calendar,
  shifted to a new start date, and removed from the calendar without deleting the
  menu.
- Calendar rows projected from a menu preserve provenance through menu placement
  data and show as menu-derived instead of editable standalone meal plan items.
- A minimal Menus section in the app shell for creating menus, adding dishes, and
  placing a menu on the calendar.
- Menu detail now has a single navigation title, a slide-in recipe browser
  inspector with search/filter controls, day-header add buttons, recipe drops
  from the browser onto a day, and drag-to-move support for menu recipes between
  days.
- Tapping a recipe from menus or the meal-calendar agenda opens the recipe in a
  full-screen presentation.
- The meal calendar now optimistically reflects item date edits/deletes while
  SQLiteData observation catches up, avoiding stale month and agenda counts after
  moving items between days.
- Week calendar cells are taller on wide layouts and allow longer recipe/note
  titles to display.
- A durable grocery schema with `groceryLists`, `groceryItems`, and
  `groceryItemSources`.
- Grocery sources preserve recipe, menu, menu placement, calendar item, and
  custom origins, including source titles/subtitles and original ingredient text.
- A minimal Groceries section in the app shell supports list creation, custom
  items, purchased state, add-from-calendar-range, add-menu, and add-recipe
  flows.
- Recipe detail groups the `Plan` and `Groceries` actions in the toolbar, and the
  groceries action opens a shoppable-ingredient review sheet before adding
  selected lines to the selected/default grocery list.
- Recipe detail shows the `Start Cooking` flame action in the recipe body near
  servings/time instead of in the toolbar.
- Generated grocery ingredients consolidate conservatively when title, unit,
  aisle, notes, and quantity shape are compatible. Compatible numeric quantities
  are added together, while each contributing origin remains represented as its
  own `GroceryItemSource` row.
- Purchased items and prep/comment-sensitive rows stay separate when generating
  groceries.
- Grocery rows expose their source breakdown in the list. Each source now has an
  actions menu that can remove only that source; the repository deletes the
  grocery row when its last source is removed and recalculates generated numeric
  quantities when a consolidated recipe/menu/calendar contribution is removed.
- Recipe detail `Shop`, grocery add-from-calendar-day, and grocery add-menu flows
  now open an ingredient-selection sheet before generating grocery rows. All
  shoppable lines start selected, and the repository can restrict generation to
  selected `IngredientLine` IDs while preserving source provenance and
  consolidation behavior.
- The ingredient-selection sheet now applies conservative pantry assumptions:
  likely staples such as salt, pepper, water, ice, common cooking oils, and
  cooking spray remain visible in a "Skipped Pantry Staples" review section but
  start deselected and can be added back with a tap.
- Settings exposes an editable Pantry list backed by app storage; one item per
  line controls which pantry staples are skipped by default in grocery selection.
- Pantry items sort alphabetically. Pantry quantity tracking remains explicitly
  out of scope; a possible future "Inventory Confirm" grocery-list section would
  need a real measurement normalization layer rather than general pantry
  inventory.
- The meal-calendar recipe picker supports adding multiple recipes in one save.
- Ingredient parsing avoids treating food words like red/celery/anchovy as units,
  splits comma preparations into notes, and normalizes anchovy fillets into the
  shoppable title "anchovies".
- Core tests cover meal calendar, menus, grocery source provenance, generated
  grocery consolidation/source-removal/ingredient-selection/pantry-assumption/
  ingredient-parsing behavior, menu item moves, and alphabetical pantry sorting.

Deferred from this slice:

- Drag/drop or direct manipulation inside the calendar grid.
- Restaurant reservation-specific UI.
- iCal import/export/sync.
- Rich menu editing: editing existing menu dishes, duplicating menus, and
  fine-grained ordering within a day.
- Higher-level source-aware grocery removal flows, such as removing a recipe's
  full contribution from a grocery list without deleting unrelated sources.
- Quantity-based pantry inventory.
- App Intents/Shortcuts implementation. Current low-hanging candidates are:
  open today's calendar, open a recipe, start cooking mode, add a recipe to a
  date defaulting to dinner, add selected recipe ingredients to groceries, and
  add a pantry assumption by name.
- Reminders/Siri integration, store/category learning, and shopping workflow
  polish.
- Importing Paprika menus or grocery lists from backup/export data, if that data
  is recoverable.

## Verification Pattern

Before checkpointing UI work:

- Run `xcodegen generate` after adding Swift source files.
- Build `YesChef` for `iPad Air 13-inch (M4)`.
- Run `scripts/check-drift.sh`.
- Install and launch on both active iOS 27 simulators:
  - `iPad Air 13-inch (M4)`
  - `iPhone 17 Pro`

Jon performs the primary UI testing pass.

Latest verification:

- `swift test --package-path YesChefPackage` passed.
- `xcodebuild -scheme YesChef -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Air 13-inch (M4)' -skipMacroValidation build` passed.
- Installing/running on both active simulators still needs a follow-up pass;
  `CoreSimulatorService`/`simdiskimaged` became unavailable during the last
  attempt after the iPad build succeeded.

## Strategic Context (not a dispatch target)

> **Next Up** above. This section captures where the larger work is heading so the architect
> can curate Next Up; it never instructs the agent directly.

Do Jon's primary UI pass on the new menu/calendar planning interactions, then
return to grocery generation and shopping workflow polish around the visible
source model.

Suggested next scope:

- Jon should do the primary UI pass on iPad and iPhone.
- Create a multi-day menu, add recipes via the day header, drag recipes from the
  browser onto days, drag menu recipes between days, place the menu on the
  calendar, shift the placement, remove the placement, and confirm the
  calendar/source relationship remains legible.
- Confirm full-screen recipe presentation from menu rows and meal-calendar agenda
  rows works naturally with the current navigation setup.
- Re-test calendar move/edit flows on adjacent days to confirm the optimistic
  refresh behavior matches the visible month, week, and agenda state.
- Polish the grocery source breakdown if Jon's UI pass finds the per-source
  actions too subtle or too noisy.
- Broaden source-aware removal from the current per-source action into higher-level
  "remove this recipe/menu/calendar contribution" flows where useful.
- Continue pantry polish if Jon's UI pass finds the conservative staple list too
  narrow or too aggressive. Do not build quantity-based pantry inventory as part
  of this slice.
- Treat Grocy as inspiration for shopping locations/assortments and product/barcode
  workflows, but keep Yes Chef recipe/planning-first rather than inventory-first.
- Revisit drag/drop from recipe rows into the calendar or groceries after the
  source model is visible to users.

Reasoning:

- The storage model can now represent multiple origins for one grocery row, and
  the UI has a first review step before generation. The next pressure point is
  making source-aware removal and skipped pantry staples equally legible.
- Paprika's grocery flow allows recipe ingredients to be chosen before adding and
  recipes to be removed from the grocery list later; Yes Chef now has the
  ingredient-selection affordance and still needs the broader removal/review
  affordances while keeping richer provenance intact.
- Source-aware removal is the next pressure test for consolidation because a
  single row may contain quantities from several recipes, menu placements, and
  calendar items.
- Pantry value comes first from making skipped known staples reviewable and easy
  to add back, not from tracking exact on-hand quantities.
- Menu drag/drop is now implemented for menus, but still needs Jon's hands-on UI
  pass across iPad and iPhone before treating it as settled.
